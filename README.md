## Data

The Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?&page=1) logs all reported crimes since 2001 and DarkSky API (https://darksky.net/dev/) has logged weather records that date back decades.

All data was indexed by day and lagged by one day so as to make my project as close to the real world as possible. All data was also segmented by Ward and the steps are shown in the notebook labeled Technical Report.ipynb within the Capstone folder.
